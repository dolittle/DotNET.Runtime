## Subscribe to a public stream in another microservice

Requests the Runtime to setup a subscription, to receive a copy of all events from a public stream (can be multiple types) of a tenant in another microservice, and put them in a scoped event log for the calling tenant. If allowed, the Runtime will continue doing this until restarted.
